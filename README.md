This is an android application that can mark attendance with an interesting UI i.e tinder swipe cards and it can generate a shareable csv file 



The main objective of this project is to make the process of taking the attendance more engaging and fun thereby providing data insights for better tracking and generating a shareable csv file.


One of the most common academic processes that institutions/universities follow is maintaining student/staff attendance. However, it has been observed that the conventional method of taking students' attendance on registers to confirm their physical presence is still prevalent. This method is time-consuming, dis-engaging, inefficient and prone to human errors. In order to address the attendance issue, this paper proposes a simple user-friendly mobile application “Attendance Marking Application” (AMA). AMA is interfaced with a Firebase in the backend for data entry and report generation. The application can track students’ attendance. The application maintains a record of the absentees that is synced with the tables in a remote database server. Attendance Marking Application reduces the time required to take attendance, prevents the loss of data as well as provisions to generate a shareable report. AMA is developed using Android Studio 4.2.1 and is compatible with 4.1(Jellybean version). 


Here are how the application functions, first, as user logged in, they have to update their details then add all classes’ details which will be reflected in recycler view click on class that you need to take attendance then just enjoy swiping left and right after all that open dashboard see data insights if you want you can download sharable report at specified location
